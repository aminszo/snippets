# ðŸ§© Code Snippets Library

This repository is a personal, organized collection of code snippets gathered over time. Some written by me, others sourced from trusted external resources (e.g. Stack Overflow, blogs, documentation). Its main purpose is to make frequently useful code easy to find and reuse.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Snippets are grouped by programming language or subject in subfolders.

Each file contains one or more related snippets, annotated with brief comments, tags, and source references where applicable.

## ðŸ”Ž Usage

- Browse folders or search within the repo (`t` to fuzzy-find on GitHub).
- Check the README indexes in each folder for quick access.
- Use and adapt freely. Attribution is included for externally sourced code.

## ðŸ“„ Notes

- External snippets include original source URLs and any modifications.
- This repo is meant for **reference, not production-ready modules**.
